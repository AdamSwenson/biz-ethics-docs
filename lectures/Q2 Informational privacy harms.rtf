\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 We\'92ve discussed when an ethical company may profit from the use of personal data. Let\'92s now turn to when things go wrong and take up a different question:\

\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\s0
\cf0 This discussion will require us to first get the hang of how people could be harmed in this way and then discuss how our ideas of blame and responsibility may need revision in light of new technology.\

\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Your mileage may vary. Some of these may seem fairly innocuous.  Some may seem creepy but not necessarily harmful. Others may seem straight-up despicable. Take a minute as you go through them to try to put your finger on what is wrong about the ones that seem wrong. More importantly, pay attention to tweaks to the details that flip your reaction from \'91meh\'92 to \'91oh hell no\'92. Those are exactly the things we\'92re going to try to uncover in understanding how uses of personal data can harm.\

Data hoarder
\f0\i0 : Red is a data hoarder. She has an intense and obsessive desire to possess data. However, she doesn\'92t actually care about the contents of the data. She just likes to know that she possesses it. Suppose \'97contrary to the real world\'97 that she keeps her data in a perfectly secure database which only she can access. She doesn\'92t look in the database; she just cares about having data, not doing anything with it. Indeed, we know that she\'92ll never use it in any way which affects people\'92s choices.\cf0 \

\f2\i Internet Isolation:
\f0\i0  Suppose you, like many people, connect with your friends and family via the social media platform SnapFace. Due to an unforeseen confluence of parameters, the site\'92s algorithm stops showing your posts to others. You don\'92t know this. But you do notice a slide in likes / comments down to zero. At first it doesn\'92t bother you. But, as time goes on and no one responds to even your best material \'97your most clever observations, your cutest outfits, the most adorable kitten/puppy/baby pictures\'97 the perceived isolation and shunning start eating at you.

\f2\i Date Screening
\f0\i0 : Through a new partnership with Tinder, Grinder, Bumble, and all the other major online dating apps, Panopticon offers ratings of prospective partners on everything from conscientiousness, cleanliness, likelihood of cheating, expected number of dates-before-sex, financial status, and other metrics. By offering users the ability to provide post-date/post-breakup ratings, it also provides ratings on kinkiness and sexual performance. [I\'92ll stop here; this is creepy enough]\

\fs26 Harms of informational privacy violation\

\fs24 \
3.1 
\fs26 Methodology\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Thus far I\'92ve tried to avoid discussing things in terms of privacy. But thinking through our cases, that\'92s no longer going to be avoidable. When we ask what\'92s going wrong in these cases, the irresistible answer is that people\'92s privacy is being violated.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Hopefully at the point in class you\'92re expecting us to dive into getting clear about what privacy is before applying the concept. If so, yay! This is usually a great strategy. Too many confusions and pointless disagreements arise when people think they\'92re arguing about the same thing but are actually talking about different things.\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf0 \
3.1.1 
\fs26 The problem with starting from privacy\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 But I\'92m not sure that starting by clarifying the concept of privacy is the best approach here. That\'92s in part because the issues we\'92re dealing with are likely to some extent genuinely new. Thus existing accounts of privacy may or may not be up to the job of dealing with them.\super \uc0\u8288 1\nosupersub  \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 More importantly, our task here is a bit different from what we\'92ve done elsewhere. Previously, we dealt with cases where we weren\'92t really sure what\'92s right and wrong. Think back to Holley. We spent a lot of time trying to come up with some principle that could help us determine when it\'92s okay for a salesperson not to divulge information. A lot of the cases we discussed left a lot of room for reasonable disagreement about what\'92s right and wrong. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The way I\'92ve constructed our task here is different. We\'92re starting with cases which nearly everyone will agree involve unacceptable activities. If the cases I\'92ve come up with don\'92t elicit those intuitions for you, I\'92d bet that we could tweak them until you\'92d agree that they involve something wrong. I wouldn\'92t have made that bet in the borderline sales cases from before. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Thus if we\'92re talking about cases which we agree involve something wrong and a concept of privacy can\'92t capture the wrongness, that\'92s a strike against the account of privacy. It doesn\'92t show us how to understand what\'92s wrong in all the cases. Put a different way, no account of privacy is likely to change our minds about the wrongness of these cases. That\'92s why I want to avoid talking directly about the concept of privacy \'97it\'92s not likely to help us in this task.\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

3.1.2 
\fs26 Focus on harmful violations of privacy \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 What\'92s the alternative? Notice that sometimes we don\'92t care very much when privacy is violated. Think of someone accidentally walking in on you in a store changing room; not great, but usually not a huge deal. But we do care a lot when people suffer harms from  their privacy is violated. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Thus the alternative is to start by thinking about how to explain how privacy violations can be harms. Approaching in this way, will also give us some resources to draw on. In particular, we can frame the discussion in terms of a well-worked out concept of harm .\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 If this approach still seems suspect, here\'92s another analogy. Legal scholars sometimes discuss what are called 
\f2\i harmless trespasses
\f0\i0 . If  you own some land and I take a shortcut across it, leaving no trace, I have still violated your legal right to control who enters your property. But I think most people would agree that prosecuting someone for a harmless trespass should normally be at the very bottom of a prosecutors\'92 priorities. We think the prosecutor should focus first on trespasses that involve harms (e.g., where I chop down your trees and knock down your fence dragging them away).\

3.2 
\fs26 The concept of harm\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 We are going to start with the pretty clear intuition that people are harmed in our cases. This allows us to get some leverage on our problems since harm is a much better worked out concept, at least in some areas of philosophy. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 I\'92m thus going to draw on an influential account of harm from philosophy of law that comes from work by Judy Thompson and Joel Feinberg. Like every view it has problems, some of which I\'92ll mention as we go, but we need not focus on those here. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \

\cf0 A bit of warning in advance, I\'92m going to go into a lot of detail about the concept of harm in what follows. We will need those details when we turn to applying it concept. But don\'92t worry if you don\'92t follow all of them on the first read of this. They are more here for reference so that you can refer back to them when you need them.\

\fs26 Harm principle\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 To begin, I\'92m going to stipulate that, on our use, harms and acts which cause harm are always grounds for public action or complaint. If you\'92ve ever heard of the \'91harm principle\'92 which comes up in discussions of criminal law, that\'92s what\'92s in the background here. The harm principle says something like: \
\pard\tx1080\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx11655\li720\ri-2160\pardirnatural\qj\partightenfactor0
\s1
\cf0 (HP) An activity may be criminalized only if it causes harm to others\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\s0
\cf0 For those of you who have heard of the harm principle, that\'92s probably because of the fact that this is a necessary condition. If we accept HP, it follows that actions which do not harm other people cannot be criminalized. Thus, at least in spirit, it comes up often in discussions of drug policy, prostitution, and any given internet list of dumb laws.\super \uc0\u8288 2\nosupersub \
\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Thus our starting point is that , by definition, \ul all harms are bad\ulnone ; \ul it is always wrong to harm others\ulnone . If this seems trivial to you, just wait. As we will see, it will mean that some things which look like harms actually are not \'97in some cases, you can kill someone without harming them.\

\fs26 Definition of harm\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 With that background in place, what is the relevant notion of harm? For the view loosely based on Thompson and Feinberg, I will say that\
\pard\tx1080\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx11655\li720\ri-2160\pardirnatural\qj\partightenfactor0
\s1
\cf0 (H) x is a harm if and only iff x is a wrongful setback of interest. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\s0
\cf0 That means there are two parts to a harm. There has to be (1) a setback of interest and (2) it has to be done in a wrongful way. This give us a framework for understanding when a harm is present. We first identify the setback. Then we ask whether it was wrong. If we can do both, there was a harm. If we can do one but not the other, there is no harm. \
\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But before we can do that, we need to get clear on what counts as a setback of interest and the relevant notion of wrongfulness.\

\fs26 Interests\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 An interest in this sense is anything you have a stake in. If you invest in a company, you now have an interest in it. There are a bunch of ways of thinking about this, but I\'92m just going to say that:\
\pard\tx1080\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx11655\li720\ri-2160\pardirnatural\qj\partightenfactor0

\s0
\cf0 Notice I didn\'92t say something like \'91the changes can affect you in a negative/positive way\'92. That\'92s because of the harm principle lurking in the background. Remember, if something turns out to be a harm, we are allowed to criminalize it (or at least morally condemn it). If I give you a cookie, that positively affects you. If the temperature of the room is a bit colder than you\'92d like, that negatively affects you. But if we say that the room being a bit chilly is a harm, given the harm principle, that means we may be okay with using the full might of the criminal law to enforce HVAC settings.\

\fs26 Well-being\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Well-being is usually something which is more spread out over time. It\'92s the sort of thing we have in mind when we talk about living a happy life. A happy life doesn\'92t mean that you were happy at every single moment. If it did, your happiness hangs by a thin thread; one stubbed toe and your life is ruined. The tricky thing with thinking in terms of well-being is to pick the right time interval for assessing it. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 You don\'92t want it to be too long. You don\'92t want it to be assessed over your entire life \'97the sort of thing you consider on your deathbed in old age when you think back over your entire life and wonder whether it was worth anything.\super \uc0\u8288 3\nosupersub  That\'92s because lots of important events will get lost. That breakup in college was really painful and tough; that first promotion was amazing. But from the perspective of your entire life, these probably won\'92t even register. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 It also better not be so short that having an unusually bad cup of coffee from the student center on Tuesday morning damages your well-being. The idea is that when we think about how things are going for us, all the minor good and minor bad should normally drop out.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Thus for our purposes, I\'92m going to stipulate (without argument) that the right time-frame for assessing well-being is about a week:\
\pard\tx1080\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx11655\li720\ri-2160\pardirnatural\qj\partightenfactor0

\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\s0
\cf0 That is, things affect your well being when they affect the quality of your week. Imagine that on Friday you grab a drink with a friend who you haven\'92t seen since last Friday. When you ask \'91how have you been?\'92 You are expecting to hear about the great date they had, the exam that they aced, the major fight they got into at work. If they start going on about how the cup of coffee they had Tuesday morning was terrible, you\'92d be pretty surprised or confused.\super \uc0\u8288 4\nosupersub  That sort of thing just usually isn\'92t a big enough deal to actually affect how good or bad their week was; it doesn\'92t usually affect their well-being. \
\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Before moving on, let\'92s summarize how we\'92ve made progress on our definition of harm. Now that we have a grip on how to assess well-being, we can rewrite (I) as \
\pard\tx1080\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx11655\li720\ri-2160\pardirnatural\qj\partightenfactor0

\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\s0
\cf0 Therefore, we can also rewrite our definition of harm\

\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 This goes all the way back to Epicures in ancient Greece, who used this to argue that it is irrational to fear death. But I\'92m getting ahead of myself. Here\'92s the puzzle, paraphrasing Epicures\

\cf0 Do you see it?  Let\'92s walk through the puzzle. When you are dead, you stop existing. There is no more you.\super \uc0\u8288 5\nosupersub  If you still exist, you are only mostly dead (send your friends to Miracle Max, ASAP!\super \uc0\u8288 6\nosupersub ).

You might take a middle ground and say something like, yeah, it\'92s irrational to fear death itself, but perfectly rational to fear dying.

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 There are other problems for this whole picture of setbacks of interest. Seana Shiffrin, for example, gives the example of a rich asshole whose hobby is going around and dropping bricks of gold on people\'92s toes and then running off. She calls this jerkwad Richie Rich.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 If you\'92ve never broken a toe, consider yourself lucky. I\'92ve had more than my share (thanks, judo). It is a particular kind of misery.  You can still basically walk and do stuff.

\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 However, at least for me, the misery of a smashed toe would be substantially offset by the $500k which came in the form of the shiny new 400oz gold bar resting on my foot. My going rate for allowing you to smash a (non-big) toe is, conveniently, about $250k. \

\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Thus if Richie Rich drops the bar on my toe, I am not worse off than I was. The bar is worth more than my smashed-toe-rate. And I\'92m also not worse off than I would\'92ve been if he had dropped the bar on someone else\'92s toe. Sure I could walk without wincing. But I\'92d much rather limp with a half a million.

\cf0 Remember, on our notion of harm, there can be bad things which happen to people which do not count as harms.

\cf0 Okay, back to our case. Does Scarlet harm Violet? In the regular English sense of the word \'91harm\'92, it\'92s obvious. She kills her. How could that not be a harm?

\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Does Scarlet setback Violet\'92s interests? Yep. Which ones? Plausibly all of them (ignoring the complication around death mentioned above). It\'92s sometimes useful to summarize this by saying that Scarlet hurts Violet.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Does Scarlet violate one or more of Violet\'92s rights? If so, which ones? This gets complicated and there are several possibilities. I\'92ll just mention two ways this can go. You can skip this if you\'92re not interested.\

\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 If the relevant right is a right to life, then it looks like there has been a rights violation. However, that means there has been a harm. Given the harm principle, that means we would be justified in punishing people who kill in genuine self-defense.\super \uc0\u8288 12\nosupersub   Violet teams up with the state to force Scarlet to choose between dying and going to jail. That does not seem plausible.\

\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 One common response is to invoke what\'92s called the \ul forfeiture theory\ulnone . When someone unjustly tries to kill another person, they (temporarily) give up their right to life during the attack. Thus the attacker does not have a right to life that could be violated. Therefore, when Scarlet kills Violet, there\'92s no harm. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 There are several problems with the forfeiture theory. It creates complications with third-party assistance (whether the attacker forfeits their right overall or just to the victim affects how we deal with cases where a third person mistakenly thinks someone is being attacked and kills the attacker on their behalf). If also leads to a weird picture of rights. Remember that rights are supposed to be absolute prohibitions on people doing things to you. To see this, consider a wrinkle in how self-defense works:\super \uc0\u8288 13\nosupersub  Suppose that when Scarlet pulls out a gun, Violet stops trying to attack. But Scarlet is all pissed off and intends to kill Violet anyway, now Violet can kill Scarlet in genuine self-defense. If we are thinking about what\'92s going on in terms the forfeiture theory of rights, it all looks weird: first Violet has no absolute protection against being killed (which Scarlet has), then Scarlet\'92s right disappears and Violet\'92s reappears. Absolute no longer means absolute.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 An alternative is just to be more careful about what the relevant right actually is. You could say that a \'91right to life\'92 is just a convenient shorthand. What we really have is a right not to be killed unjustly. If the relevant right is a right to not be killed unjustly, then we ask when is it justifiable to kill. The answer will include what I said above in describing genuine self-defense. In other words, on this version of the right, self-defense is one of the built in exceptions to the prohibition on killing. Thus on this picture too, there will no rights violation when Scarlet kills Violet and therefore no harm.\

We all have bad habits and psychological weaknesses. Sometimes, we try really hard to hide them from others. The fact that these habits and vulnerabilities may be present in personal data about us or inferred from such data creates a significant opportunity for others to exploit them in ways which may significantly set back our interests. \

If someone can identify your weaknesses and vulnerabilities by closely monitoring past behaviors and dispositions, that person may be able to shape your choices, actions, transactions, and purchasing decisions in ways that do not accord with principles and purposes to which you are committed. Even if you succeed, in your deliberate actions, to stay true to these purposes and principles, others may have their own reasons for targeting your weaknesses, prejudices, or vulnerabilities, and, thereby undermining your autonomy. \{Barocas:2009ws\}\

\cf2 Now, it will matter how significant these weaknesses are and what behaviors they can get you to do. Remember, for something to be a harm, the setback has to affect your well-being. Take a minor bad habits like spending more time than you\'92d like on sites dedicated to celebrity gossip. If an online advertiser cunningly lures you back to such sites, that does set back your interests. But if it\'92s just a few more minutes a day, the setback may not rise to the appropriate level for it to genuinely count as a harm. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\partightenfactor0
\cf2 That said, we should be sensitive to cumulative effects. We can imagine cases in which each manipulative advertiser succeeds in stealing a few minutes a week from you. On its own, not enough for a harm. But together, you are wasting a couple of hours a week on sites which you don\'92t really want to be visiting. That would potentially be a harm.

If you knew your employer or life insurance company would see that you\'92ve gone to a bar every night, you might hesitate to celebrate with your friends (even if you don\'92t drink). Presumably, your interest in spending time with your friends is threatened here, as well as your interest in keeping your job, and your interest in being able to care for your family if you die.

I am normally said to be free to the degree to which no man or body of men interferes with my activity. Political liberty in this sense is simply the area within which a man can act unobstructed by others. If I am prevented by others from doing what I could otherwise do, I am to that degree unfree; and if this area is contracted by other men beyond a certain minimum, I can be described as being coerced, or, it may be, enslaved. Coercion is not, however, a term that covers every form of inability. If I say that I am unable to jump more than ten feet in the air, or cannot read because I am blind\'85it would be eccentric to say that I am to that degree enslaved or coerced. Coercion implies the deliberate interference of other human beings within the area in which I could otherwise act. You lack political liberty or freedom only if you are prevented from attaining a goal by other human beings (Berlin, 1969: 122).\

 \
The interference doesn\'92t have to be completely obvious, like someone blocking the door you want to enter. Indeed, the interference can turn heavily on your own self-censorship. If you know that all of your internet browsing history will be publicly available, you probably will not use the internet the way you would if others weren\'92t watching. You might not watch the frivolous videos that help you relax after work. You might not google for embarrassing health information. You might not use the internet to help you explore your sexual identity.

How could the basis for an appealing contemporary political program be found in such writings (Goldsmith 2000; Maddox 2002; Goodin 2003; McCormick 2003)?\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 \

\cf0 Second, this is not \'91republican\'92 in the sense of the American Republican party. There may be some ideological connections, but where they exist, it\'92s because some members of the Republican party are attracted to this position in political philosophy, not the other way around. \

\cf0 Indeed, my sense is that American political alignments cut across liberal and republican political philosophies. You can find threads of liberal political philosophy deeply woven into the commitments of some American Republicans and threads of republican political philosophy deeply woven into the commitments of some American Democrats.\

The fact that a government or company holding personal information is in position to use it in ways which might harm people means that the government or company dominates them. \

\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\partightenfactor0
\cf2 Thus it looks like the republican has more resources to complain about violations of privacy independent of their effects, which, we saw, was the weakness of the liberal emphasis on actual interference. Indeed, a serious strength of this picture is that concerns about invasion of protected sphere of information need not track probability of interference.\

One complication for our purposes facing the republican view is that in many cases individual collections of your information don\'92t put a company / person in a position to dominate you. That may be sometimes true, as when it concerns something that might embarrass you. But the challenge posed by machine learning is that in the aggregate, patterns can be extracted from pieces of seemingly innocuous data. Those patterns may establish a domination relationship.\

\cf0 For example, the original business model of gmail was to serve users ads based on keywords located in emails they send and receive. There was no Google employee behind the scenes reading your emails and determining which ads to show you. The process was entirely algorithmic. An outdoor brand would pay Google to advertise to people interested in, say, hiking. Google would look for words like \'91tent\'92 or \'91hiking boots\'92 in emails and serve ads to people sending/receiving those emails. To people who felt this violated their privacy, the response (I\'92m paraphrasing) would be \'91but you and the recipient are the only humans looking at the emails.

\cf0 Let\'92s try to think through whether there could be harms in these sorts of cases using the various theories we\'92ve discussed.\

\fs26 No. Understanding matters\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Before we get to that, let\'92s mention one very flat-footed reply: No machine can violate privacy because machines do not understand what they are \'91reading\'92. The argument thus may go:\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 (1) A violates B\'92s privacy regarding x only if A understands x.\
(2) Machines cannot understand anything.\
Therefore, (3) Machines cannot violate privacy.\
\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 We could fight about premise (2). But that would take us on a long detour through philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. So we won\'92t.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 More importantly, we don\'92t need to worry about (2) unless (1) is true since it makes the privacy violation depend on the existence of understanding. If (1) is false, then it may be that privacy can be violated even when there is no understanding. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\fi360\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Why would we believe (1)? If you start with the thought that what we care about is other people knowing stuff about us, it will seem plausible. Suppose that someone steals your bag containing the diary in which you\'92ve written all your deepest darkest secrets while you are traveling in a country where no one speaks English (and phones which can translate text in a picture don\'92t exist). Are you worried about your privacy? If you are, this view would claim, it\'92s only because you\'92re worrying that someone who speaks English will come along and read it. If you are certain that won\'92t ever happen, then you shouldn\'92t be concerned. And, certainly, we wouldn\'92t say that your privacy has already been violated as soon as the theft occurred. \

\cf0 \
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But we\'92ve already seen that the harms we\'92re concerned with do not turn on the question of whether anyone/anything understand what they read. On all of our accounts, the harm can arise from self-censorship. And, thinking of cases like the Argument Tweeter or People-Rating, should remind us that we care about the ways our information can be used regardless of whether there is an understanding agent in the loop.\

\cf0 1. Obviously, to really establish that we\'92d need to work through all of the existing accounts and carefully consider their strengths and weaknesses for dealing with our concerns. That\'92s a Ph.D. dissertation; we\'92re not going to do that here.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 2. Note that this doesn\'92t automatically show that any of these things shouldn\'92t be illegal. Drug use often negatively affects those around the user; prostitution is often bad for the prostitutes. It just reframes the question to whether these are harms in the relevant sense and gives us a means of answering that question.\

\cf0 4. Assuming that your friend is not a serious coffee snob. I had a good friend in graduate school who took his coffee super seriously (he taught me how to roast green coffee beans). I could imagine one bad coffee really sticking in his craw so much that it would still be on his mind several days later.\

\cf0 5. NB, if you are religious and believe in an afterlife or if you are a big fan of Pharrell (http://nooneeverreallydies.com/), then in this sense, you believe that no one ever really dies. You would agree with Epicures that it is irrational to fear death; it might of course be rational to fear what happens after death.\

\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 10. There are plenty of legitimate arguments we can have over exactly what should count as self-defense. My philosophy of law class spends literally  half the semester working through them; and I don\'92t want to pretend I know what the answers are. However, I will say the subjective perceptions of the killer cannot be determinative in anything like a just society. (IIRC, the NRA and other backers of \'91stand your ground\'92 laws agree and characterize the Florida law/cases as mistakes)\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 11. Some jurisdictions carve out the \'91castle doctrine\'92 such that you have no duty to retreat if you are attacked in your own home.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 12. Actually, this doesn\'92t have to be true. There are other kinds of defenses under the criminal law that could get her off the hook. But that\'92s too far afield.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 13. Yes, there actually have been cases like this.\

\cf0 30. Perfectionism in ethics is concerned with things like achievement and excellence.
